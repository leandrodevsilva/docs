1. Go to the [<u>Port a number</u>](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-number) page and choose Port Type: Calls & Texts.
2. Fill out the information on the page.
3. You can find the Account Number on the billing statement near the top right corner. It is typically 5 or 6 digits long.
4. Vonage does not use PIN numbers, so you can use 0000 for the Transfer/Port-away PIN.
5. Make sure to use the first and last name found in the top left area of the billing statement for Authorized Representative Name. You'll need to provide the email of that person when specifying the Authorized Representative Email.
