# **Why Keep an Archiving Provider Acknowledgment?**

**For SEC & FINRA Compliance Preparedness**

## **Purpose**

The **Archiving Provider Acknowledgment** documents that your firm has **formally designated** CurrentClient as your system of record for business‑related electronic messaging.

It serves as **evidence for regulators** that:

- You have a **known, approved** archiving system.
- The provider understands **what regulations require**.
- You have performed **due diligence** on your vendor.

## **Regulatory Background**

## **Benefits in an Audit**

When the SEC or FINRA examines your firm, they often ask:

1. **What system do you use for archiving?**
2. **How do you know it meets the rules?**
3. **Do you have proof you’ve reviewed the vendor’s compliance capabilities?**

The acknowledgment answers all three in a **single page** — speeding the exam and reducing the chance of follow‑up questions.

## **Best Practice**

- Keep a **signed or finalized** copy in your **compliance binder** or digital compliance folder.
- Store it alongside your **communications retention policy**.
- Update it if you change vendors or platforms.

## **Bottom Line**

While **not explicitly required by SEC or FINRA rules**, the acknowledgment letter is a **proven compliance tool**.\
It’s an easy way to show you have **documented oversight** of your archiving provider — a step that can protect your firm in an audit.
