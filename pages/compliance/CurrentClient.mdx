## **1. Overview**

This document describes how CurrentClient meets **SEC Rule 17a‑4**, the **Investment Advisers Act of 1940**, and **FINRA Rules 3110 & 4511** recordkeeping and supervision requirements.

**Audience:** Compliance officers, auditors, and regulators reviewing the use of CurrentClient for compliant communications archiving.

## **2. Record Capture**

CurrentClient automatically captures:

- **Text Messages (SMS/MMS)** – Full message content including media files.
- **Metadata** – Sender/recipient, date/time, message ID, delivery status.

Records are captured in real time and stored immediately in a secure archive.

## **3. Retention & Regulatory Compliance**

- Retained for a **minimum of 5 years**; first 2 years instantly retrievable.
- Stored in **AWS S3 with object versioning enabled**.
- Original records cannot be overwritten — edits/deletions create a **new immutable version** while retaining the original.
- Version history includes timestamps, user/process changes, and access to prior versions.
- Aligns with **SEC Rule 17a‑4(f)** 2022 amendments allowing version‑controlled, audit‑capable systems.

## **4. Integrity & Security**

- **Version Control** – Preserves all historical versions of a record.
- **Audit Logging** – Tracks access, exports, and modifications.
- **Encryption** – TLS 1.2\+ in transit, AES‑256 at rest.
- **Access Controls** – Role‑based permissions to restrict who can view, search, or export records.

## **5. Supervision & Review Tools**

- **Searchable Archive** – Search by client, keyword, date range, or record type.
- **Supervision Workflows** – CurrentClient supports supervision by:
  - Sending all captured messaging data to the firm’s **chosen third‑party archiving system** for review, or
  - **Co‑locating** all captured messaging data into the firm’s **existing email archive** so their current supervision workflows apply.
- **Review Logs** – If the firm uses CurrentClient’s direct archive export, activity logs record when reviews occur and by whom.

## **6. Retrieval for Regulatory Requests**

- **Export Capabilities** – CSV, PDF, and media formats for regulators.
- **Time‑Stamped Certification** – Confirms record authenticity.
- **No Gaps in Records** – Continuous capture with no user‑side deletion.

## **7. Advisor Responsibilities**

Advisors must:

- Maintain a **written communications retention and supervision policy**.
- Periodically review communications for compliance issues.
- Ensure all business messaging takes place through CurrentClient or other approved channels.

## **8. CurrentClient Commitment**

CurrentClient is committed to:

- Providing advisors with a compliant, secure messaging archive.
- Maintaining system compliance with SEC/FINRA rules.
- Supporting retrieval requests during regulatory audits.
